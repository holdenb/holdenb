### Holden Babineaux 

##
Currently working on cool stuff involving autonomous mobile robots that move heavy objects ðŸ¤˜ ...and trudging along through grad school studying robotics and modern control.

I have a passion for understanding how humans can control dynamical and chaotic systems.

I've done some other cool things involving maritime autonomous systems and high-performance distributed systems in the healthcare space.

I have a personal space/blog and one day I'll start posting some things...(I really just wanted an excuse to build something from scratch using the GOTH stack -- Golang/Templ/HTMX lol).
You can find it here: <a href="https://holdenb.com">City of Poets</a>

Also working on a neat project that I hope to soon announce...spoilers here: <a href="https://hearth.fit">Hearth.fit</a> (Don't judge the default site/theme!!).
