### Holden Babineaux 

##
Currently working on autonomous mobile robots that move heavy objects. <br>
Also doing the grad school thing, studying robotics and automatic control.

I have a passion for understanding how humans manage to control seemingly chaotic systems.

I have a personal space/blog. One day I'll start posting some things. <br>
I really just wanted an excuse to build something from scratch using the GOTTH stack (Golang/Templ/Tailwind/HTMX). <br>
