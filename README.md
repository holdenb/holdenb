### Holden Babineaux

Currently working on cool stuff involving autonomous mobile robots that move heavy objects ðŸ¤˜ ...and trudging along through grad school studying robotics and modern control.

I have a passion for understanding how humans can control dynamical and chaotic systems.

I've done some other cool things involving maritime autonomous systems and high-performance distributed systems in the healthcare space.

I have a personal space/blog. One day I'll start posting some things (I really just wanted an excuse to build something from scratch using the GOTH stack -- Golang/Templ/HTMX).
